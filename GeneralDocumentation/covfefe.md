Here is a description of the various changes done to the system.

-- PDF Conversion --

Those with access to articles (either as a superuser or as the author of the article) can convert articles to PDF, which can be sent to Scholarly Commons.

It's a fairly simple process. There is a button (or link) labeled Convert To PDF. Clicking that will extract the JSON version of the article and convert it to PDF.

Due to the libraries being used, some of the multimedia aspects of the article will not be shown. For instance, there will be no images or other forms of media aside from text. There will be links to external wabpages. 

-- Table of Contents --

For all of the books in the database, there will be a table of contents for all the published books. This will be done automatically.

-- Changes to Structure of Scalar --


-- Changes to Language in Scalar --

To get closer to what we want to show in Scalar, the language throughout Scalar has changed to reflect the roles we wanted to utilize. Mainly, changes have been made to account for the Author, Reviewer, and Editor role. Authors have similar roles to what they have now. Editors now take the place of commenters, and have special privileges (since they're engaging in peer reviews). As for editors, those changes will have to be discussed and implemented. 

-- Versioning --

-- Peer Reviews --

This will be used in lieu of comments. Those with editor priveleges will be able to comment. These will be the bases for the peer reviews. In regard to implementation, I haven't gotten there yet.

-- If Updates to Scalar Need to be Made --

I (Joe Pires) have commented all of the parts that I have edited. All of those comments have my name in them. To find the parts that I worked on, just search for 'Joe Pires' in the code.
